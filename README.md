# Message Jar

[Message Jar](https://github.com/gavhu10/MessageJar/) is a messaging platform written in Python with Flask. This is a client for it, based off of the excellent [MicroCOM](https://github.com/geo-tp/MicroCOM) project by geo-tp. Also used in this project is the SdService code from the [Cardputer Game Station Emulators](https://github.com/geo-tp/Cardputer-Game-Station-Emulators/tree/xip_load), which is also made by geo-tp.

## Config

Message jar loads its configuration from `mjconfig.json`. Here is an example config:  
```json
{
  "ssid": "MyWifiNetwork",
  "wifipassword": "wifi password",
  "userpassword": "password",
  "username": "user",
  "room": "lobby"
}
```

- <b>Terminal</b>: Use `Keys` and `OK` button to send commands
